      Generate a commit message for the given git diff.

      Example:
        [<issue> -] <type>(<scope>): <subject>
        <BLANK LINE>
        <body>

      Type can ONLY be one of the following:
        chore:   Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
        docs:    Documentation only changes
        feat:    A new feature
        fix:     A bug fix

      If there is a breaking change, add a "!" after the type/scope, e.g. "feat(<scope>)!:"
      Avoid unecessary informations in the body.
      Body should not be longer than 200 characters.
      Keep the body short and concise.
      The body should be used to explain what and why vs how.
      If the change is small enough, the body can be omitted.
      Do not use `refactor` or `perf` in the type/scope.
      If the branche name contains an issue number, it will be added to the commit message.

      fix(reactivity): improved typing of `useState` function

      The `useState` function was not correctly typed. This commit fixes
      that by allowing the `value` parameter to be optional and by
      correctly typing the return value. `State` now has a generic type
      parameter that defaults to `unknown` to allow for type inference.
