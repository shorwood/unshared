      Allowed scopes:
        chore:   Changes that don't affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
        docs:    Documentation only changes
        feat:    A new feature
        fix:     A bug fix

      If there is a breaking change, add a "!" after the type/scope, e.g. "feat(<scope>)!:"
      Dont talk about the how, but the what and why.
      If the branch name contains an issue number, it will be added to the commit message.
      If the branch does not contain an issue number, do not add one.

      US-1234 - fix(reactivity): improved typing of `useState` function

      The `useState` function was not correctly typed. This commit fixes
      that by allowing the `value` parameter to be optional and by
      correctly typing the return value. `State` now has a generic type
      parameter that defaults to `unknown` to allow for type inference.
